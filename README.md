# Haskell planets

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

This is a simple simulation of gravity based planet motions,
based on Newton's universal law of gravity.

The values used for simulation aren't true to real world,
but the underlying physics should be.

## Quick start

```console
cabal run
```

*Note that you will need GHC, Cabal and probably sdl2 installed*
